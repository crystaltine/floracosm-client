Public repository for [Floracosm](floracosm.org) just because.
I hope this doesn't expose any security issues.

The server repository will remain hidden because I actually think open-sourcing that would expose some major issues (hehe)

There are plenty of unused assets here, plus a cacophony of terrible code. pls dont laugh at me
